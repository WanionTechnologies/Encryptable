# Sponsorship Goals & Funding Strategy

**Encryptable is committed to becoming a professionally validated, enterprise-ready privacy framework** while remaining free and open-source forever.

Professional security audits and sustainable development require funding. This document outlines our transparent, tiered sponsorship goals and what each funding level enables.

## 💖 [Sponsor Encryptable's Development & Security](https://github.com/sponsors/WanionCane)

We have three realistic sponsorship goals, each representing a progressively ambitious vision for building privacy-first tools:

---

## 🎯 Goal #1: $3,000/month - Full-Time Development & Audit Funding

**First goal: $3,000/month in sponsorships** to dedicate full-time effort to developing and maintaining Encryptable.

### What your sponsorship funds:
- 🛠️ **Full-time development** - New features, bug fixes, documentation
- 🔒 **Initial professional security audit** - $4,000-6,000 one-time investment for comprehensive cryptographic validation
- 🔄 **Ongoing security validation** - $2k-4k per major version + $2k-3k annual re-certification
- 📚 **Educational resources** - Tutorials, examples, and best practices documentation
- 🌐 **Ecosystem growth** - Integration with other frameworks and tools

### Why ongoing audit funding matters:

Security isn't a one-time expense—it's an ongoing commitment:
- **Initial audit (~$5k):** Full comprehensive review of Encryptable's cryptographic implementation (~500 lines of core crypto code)
- **Major version updates (~$2k-4k each):** Re-audit of changed cryptographic components
- **Annual re-certification (~$2k-3k/year):** Maintains compliance as threats evolve and enterprise customers require up-to-date validation

At $3,000/month, full-time work on Encryptable is sustainable, and funds can be gradually built for both the initial audit and ongoing security validations—ensuring the framework remains production-ready for years to come.

### 🎯 What Will Change After a Professional Security Audit?

A professional security audit will transform Encryptable from a cryptographically sound framework to a **production-validated, enterprise-ready solution**.

**What you'll get:**
- ✅ **Official security certification** - Published audit report from qualified cryptographers for the **framework itself**
- ✅ **Easier app compliance** - Using an audited framework significantly reduces your application's audit scope and cost
- ✅ **Framework compliance validated** - Encryptable's cryptographic implementation certified for PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2
- ✅ **Vulnerability remediation** - Any issues found in the framework will be fixed and documented
- ✅ **Customer confidence** - Third-party validation of the encryption layer you're using
- ✅ **Reduced liability** - Professional attestation of the framework limits your legal exposure

> **Important:** The audit certifies **Encryptable itself**, not your application.\
> Your app will still need its own compliance validation, but using an audited encryption framework makes that process **significantly cheaper and faster** since the cryptographic layer is already certified.

**What WON'T change:**
- ❌ **Free & open-source forever** - No change to license or pricing
- ❌ **Core architecture** - The cryptographic design is already sound
- ❌ **API compatibility** - No breaking changes expected

**Our commitment:** Whether or not the audit gets funded, Encryptable will remain free and open-source.\
The audit would simply unlock its full potential for production use with sensitive data.\
We're being transparent about this limitation so you can make informed decisions about where to use Encryptable.

## 📊 Why We Have Multiple Goals

**Progressive ambition explained:**

Each tier builds upon the previous foundation. The progression represents not just more resources, but fundamentally different scales of impact:

- **$3k/month:** Solo sustainable development with audit path
- **$7.5k/month:** Professional company brand (Wanion Technologies) with small focused team
- **$15k/month:** Professional team with realistic global talent, focused sequential development

**The Wanion Technologies milestone ($7.5k) is strategic:**
- Transitions from "individual developer project" to "technology company"
- Establishes professional brand infrastructure (wanion.tech, encryptable.wanion.tech)
- Makes Encryptable "a product by Wanion Technologies" (scalable for future products)
- Opens doors for enterprise partnerships and serious investment conversations

**We believe in radical transparency:**

- The **$3k goal** is **achievable and sustainable**—enables full-time development with audit funding
- The **$7.5k goal** is **strategic and realistic**—establishes Wanion Technologies as a professional brand with a small focused team
- The **$15k goal** is **ambitious but achievable** through geographic arbitrage and focused execution—builds the complete privacy ecosystem

This isn't just about building software—it's about creating production-ready privacy tools that developers can trust and use with confidence.

## 🌟 Beyond Sponsorships: Building Sustainability

While we've outlined sponsorship goals, **Encryptable's long-term sustainability won't rely solely on sponsorships**. As the project matures, we plan to explore complementary revenue streams:

- **Enterprise support contracts** - Professional support and SLA guarantees for companies using Encryptable in production
- **Managed hosting** - Optional hosted database service for teams that prefer not to self-host
- **Training and certification** - Professional training programs and developer certifications
- **Consulting services** - Architecture review and implementation assistance for complex use cases
- **Other projects** - Development of complementary tools, plugins, privacy-focused applications, and websites focused on privacy that leverage the Encryptable ecosystem

**Key commitment:** The core framework will **always remain free and open-source** (MIT License), regardless of any commercial services built around it. Commercial offerings would fund continued open-source development, not replace it.
